So bear with me.</p></blockquote><p>Hi there. It‚Äôs been a while since the last time I wrote a post here. There is some stuff I‚Äôm currently working on at the beginning of this year. And those were pretty busy days.</p><p>Anyway, tonight I will a little bit tell you about a song that I love to listen to a couple of weeks back. I do listen to music on some occasions, such as when working on some web stuff and while I‚Äôm about to sleep.</p><p>I actually didn‚Äôt enjoy listening to a random song that Spotify or YouTube give to me while I‚Äôm on duty. I prefer listening to a playlist with one or two songs that I currently love, repeatedly, over and over again, haha. And I won‚Äôt switch it before I feel bored. It takes weeks or even a month to get bored.</p><p>I don‚Äôt like to listen to a random song because sometimes when I couldn‚Äôt bear with a certain song, I should switch it manually and that will break my focus. And get a focus back is sometimes tough tho.</p><p>Well, enough talking!</p><h3 id="Fireworks-by-DAOKO"><a href="#Fireworks-by-DAOKO" class="headerlink" title="Fireworks by DAOKO"></a>Fireworks by DAOKO</h3><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-tKVN2mAKRI" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>I accidentally found this song while I‚Äôm coding. I made my YouTube playlist plays random songs and didn‚Äôt get me disturbed because I was totally focused on fixing tough bugs at that time. And in the middle of coding, I just got realized that it‚Äôs beautiful. Now, even after few months passed, I still love to listen to this song, haha.</p><p>This song was featured in an anime movie called ‚ÄúFireworks, Should We See It from the Side or the Bottom?‚Äù which telling us about a high school love story and its dilemma. It is a pretty good movie, but many people complaining about its obscure ending. It has 5.5 ratings from IMDb (not that bad) but if I could argue, it deserves higher ratings.</p><h3 id="A-humble-love-story-in-high-school"><a href="#A-humble-love-story-in-high-school" class="headerlink" title="A humble love story in high school"></a>A humble love story in high school</h3><p>Two things that made me love this song: First this song itself and second the movie! I couldn‚Äôt lie, I missed college and high school life so bad. Since I didn‚Äôt go to college a year ago due to pandemic, therefore I love watching some movies about college/school life, for the sake of nostalgia, lol.</p><p>The reason why this movie special is that the humble love story it has. If you guys try to remember when we were in high school, the love story there was pretty simple: Always seeks time to be together, doing tasks together, having a nice little chit-chat, and so on.</p><p>When we‚Äôre getting older, love isn‚Äôt the same anymore. We do need more commitment and preparation to dive into life after school. Now, love requires us more than just itself. It‚Äôs pretty complicated. And that‚Äôs why I feel like haven‚Äôt ready yet to have an ‚Äòafter-school-life‚Äô love.</p><p>I have so many memories about love in high school, haha. I even have a date with one of the most adored girls in my school (for real haha). And at the end of high school, I meet my last girlfriend in high school (now my ex) and she was a popular girl in her school as well (we are from a different school).</p><p>That time was great, but don‚Äôt get me wrong, I was a nerdy and shy boy at school but somehow active in some organizations, therefore I didn‚Äôt date my crush/girlfriend like a common cool boy out there. My love stories were just as simple as this story in this movie.</p><p>That‚Äôs probably the reason why I still love to listen to this song. Because every time I played it, it reminds me of the movie that brings me many nostalgic love stories when I was in high school.</p><h3 id="End-of-nostalgic-mumbo-jumbo"><a href="#End-of-nostalgic-mumbo-jumbo" class="headerlink" title="End of nostalgic mumbo-jumbo"></a>End of nostalgic mumbo-jumbo</h3><p>It‚Äôs nice to have some nostalgic memories when listening to music. But that‚Äôs a past, and life is supposed to keep moving on. And it is good to keep memories in its deserved place.</p><p>Anyway, since I mentioned my ex, I always hope she is well now. I couldn‚Äôt lie, after she left me, I haven‚Äôt had another girlfriend yet. I learned one big thing from my past love story with her: I haven‚Äôt ready to love someone, even when I truly love her at that time, but I actually still being a silly ambitious person who just cares about my own life.</p><p>If someone asks me about my feeling for her, I‚Äôll say that I still have a feeling for her. I know it‚Äôs silly since I knew she already has a crush/boyfriend right now, but I don‚Äôt know why. Somehow it is still echoing deep inside in mine.</p><p>But the bright side is I now don‚Äôt need to deal with loving or looking for someone at this time. We all know, loving someone takes energy and time tho. And in this crucial time between the end of college and the beginning of real-life after school, I wanna use my focus and time on things I‚Äôm currently working on (sounds still being a silly ambitious person isn‚Äôt it? Haha).</p><p>Well, end of whining, back to real-life!</p><hr><section id="comments" class="mt-2 mb-3"><div id="disqus_thread"><button href="#" type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" onclick="return loadDisqus(),!1">Lihat/Buat Komentar</button></div><script>var disqus_config=function(){this.page.url="https://adisaktijrs.github.io/2021/01/21/draft-fireworks/index.html",this.page.identifier="2021/01/21/draft-fireworks/index.html",this.page.title="(Draft) Fireworks: A mesmerizing song about a high school love story"},is_disqus_loaded=!1;function loadDisqus(){if(!is_disqus_loaded){is_disqus_loaded=!0;var i=document,s=i.createElement("script");s.src="https://https-adisaktijrs-github-io.disqus.com/embed.js",s.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(i.head||i.body).appendChild(s)}}</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript></section></div></div><div class="row mt-4"><div class="col text-center"><p class="pb-0 mb-2">Dibuat dengan ‚ù§ dan <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none" rel="noreferrer"><svg style="width:15px;fill:#03adfc" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><title>Hexo.js</title><path d="M12 .007L1.57 6.056V18.05L12 23.995l10.43-6.049V5.952L12 .007zm4.798 17.105l-.939.521-.939-.521V12.94H9.08v4.172l-.94.521-.938-.521V6.89l.939-.521.939.521v4.172h5.84V6.89l.94-.521.938.521v10.222z"/></svg> </a>di <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kendal+jawa+tengah" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kendal</a>.</p></div></div><div class="row mb-5 mt-0 pt-0"><div class="col text-center">@adisaktijrs</div></div></div></div></div><script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-DfXdz2htPH0lsSSs5nCTpuj/zy4C+OGpamoFVy38MVBnE+IbbVYUew+OrCXaRkfj" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.5.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-ho+j7jyWK8fNQe+A12Hb8AhRq26LrZ/JpcUGGOn+Y7RsweNrtN/tE3MoK7ZeZDyx" crossorigin="anonymous"></script></body></html>
