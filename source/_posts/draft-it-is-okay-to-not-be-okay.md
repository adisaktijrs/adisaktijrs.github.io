Hi, this is a part of the [Draft article](https://adisaktijrs.github.io/2020/12/22/draft-what-is-this/) where I wrote random thoughts to learn writing in English. So bear with me.
{% endblockquote %}

I stare at my laptop, doing nothing, and I am doing it for more than an hour. Yeah, I'm trying to do my plans to write a random article that I thought will be useful. Or at least, can be an informative story.

I start to write something about CodeWars, but then my head flies away on inner thoughts about things I scare most of the time. Something about the future always haunts me. Some stuff of what kind of life I want to live, or what kind of job I wanna do in my entire life.

When it comes to my future path, to be honest, I have no idea about it. I even cannot write it down on this post. I try to think about the dream I have. But in every option I have, I always question myself; 'do I really want it? Does it the thing I wanna do in my entire life? Am I happy with it?' and so on.

I know it's a common thing for 20s people. They often call it the Quarter Life Crisis. Well yeah, it is a true crisis for me. I know I already have plans that I will try to do in my daily life. It's helpful to guide me to achieve something I want. But it just one piece of glass of a big mosaic. I still need to choose what direction I want to take and what things I need to carry.

The path to the future is always an obscure option. It seems to be something that inevitably comes with a cost. And for now and later I think I will necessarily be an uncertain piece of paper. Write things this and that, and sometimes make revisions.

But there is one thing certain. Every day, every second of the time, life keeps moving on. And I always and should move. Wherever my feet take me, I'll make sure that it will be a place that I love.

Life isn't always easy and sometimes unpredictable, so it's okay to not be okay. It's still a wonderful and memorable journey.
