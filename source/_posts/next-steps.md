_Updated - Jan 30, 2023_
I still got no time tho, lol. But in this very short update, I just want to remind myself that I should be grateful for everything that I have, the journey so far, love, fams, friends, and life.

Life has its ups and downs, indeed. But, still, this world is full of miracles and beauty.
