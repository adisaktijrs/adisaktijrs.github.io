Wow, time flies indeed too fast! It's been almost a year since the last time I wrote a post on this blog. 2021 is a quite different year than 2020 where I spend most of my time to done something important, such as learning many tech stuff, doing my bachelor thesis, and growing my side business. But this year, I didn't think that I use most of my time wisely. But ya, I did enjoy some new things that I did this year.

I can say that 2021 shaped me into another version of myself. I feel like I just going with the flow and lost to nowhere, without any plans and directions that I wanna go. Don't get me wrong, I did my daily activities like doing my bachelor thesis (sometimes hehe), maintaining my sites, making designs, and going outside. And I still have my short-term goals.

The thing that lacks and unfortunately one of the most important things, I guess, is that I lose my long-term goal. I don't know where I wanna go and what thing I wanna achieve in life. Without that thing, of course, I lose my ambition and it generates the thing I hate the most: boredom!

I already faced this kind of situation when I was in my second year of college for about six months, but I never thought that it would come again to my life. At that time, it's so much easier for me to back on track, since I was surrounded by many friends back then (that are so damn passionate about things they love) their energy is so lit and inspiring!

I've always admired people who are so passionate in their field.

Anyway, I think the easiest way that I can do right now is to focus on my bachelor thesis and graduate ASAP (I easily get distracted by so many things that amaze me, like new techs, new ways to generate money, and so on hehe). After finishing my degree, I guess it would open other doors that can lead me to another new stage of life while keep trying to plan stuff for my future. But why do I need that long-term goal? Ofc, to make me stay hungry to achieve it day by day, stay motivated, and get rid of my boredom.

I hope I can stick to this plan, cause I couldn't bear with this boredom anymore. Wish me luck!

P.S. Please bear with my grammar, I hate it, but I'll always work on it.
