Hi, this is a part of the [Draft article](https://adisaktijrs.github.io/2020/12/22/draft-what-is-this/) where I wrote random thoughts to learn writing in English. So bear with me.

It is the second day of my English writing project. I couldn't lie that it is pretty difficult to force writing things when no ideas popping up, haha. Yet, I will force myself to write anything that I have in my now-brain.

### I'm a bad planner
I admit it. In every plan I have made, there is always a day when I thought: 'oh, this plan is no longer relevant' or something like 'mm, I guess, it would be better if I go with this new one' and then I threw away plans I have made before.

I know it's good to always open to the new thing that coming-up. But, in my case, it's a little bit different. I get bored easily! And it affects my plans as well. Sometimes I decided to create the brand new one or even worse, I didn't do my plans and then doing things without any clear aims. But whatever happened, I always try to have plans.

### I'll continue planning!
The reason why I force myself to have some plans at all times is pretty crucial. It's because it will maintain my ambition and curiosity level. I love to be an ambitious person. I know it sounds a little bit annoying but lemme tell you the other pov.

Being an ambitious person can bring us to a brand new challenging adventure on a thing we love every day! Because we always try to push ourselves to be better day by day to achieve what we want. You probably think: 'Uh, another ambitious person...' Yep, but trust me, I have done with my realistic version of me.

Perhaps, it was in the third year of college when I decided to live 'just go with the flow'. It went fine for a few weeks, but then I started to felt a loss of desire. Everything felt flat and bland. That was a horrible feeling. It even exceeds the annoying old-friend: Boredom.

That's why I now prefer to be an ambitious person at a specific major, rather than being a realistic one.

Without goals, and plans to reach them, you are like a ship that has set sail with no destination

### Now
Anyway, for now, I have some plans that I wanna focus on. I want to dedicate my time mostly to those things. You probably already know that. Yeah, I plan to focus on learning a few things and do some activities regularly. In my daytime, I will focus on learning web development, especially on front-end dev with React. At night, I will continue to improve my English skill by writing random stuff on this blog.

I also want to keep doing a workout/jogging two or three times a week. It's a critical investment for young people I guess, but most people missed it, so do I, haha.
