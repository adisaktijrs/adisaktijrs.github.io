Hi, this is a part of the [Draft article](https://adisaktijrs.github.io/2020/12/22/draft-what-is-this/) where I wrote random thoughts to learn writing in English. So bear with me.

Hi there! I know I'm supposed to write things on weekdays. But since it is Sunday, so I can do anything I want, lol.

Mm Tbh, I didn't do my daily writing project last Thursday and Friday, haha. I know it broke my latest plans, but since I was pretty busy on those two days, therefore, I couldn't keep my promise.

Btw, this is my second week of learning Reactjs. I am happy to study it. There are so many things I have learned from the course I joined. I love the way Reactjs handles UI components and because of Babel/Webpack, it is possible to use modern Js (ES6) to build web apps, and it's so much fun.

Nevertheless, I found some concepts that so hard to be understood. And the thing that made me uncomfortable was the reality that it still the basic concept of Reactjs ('immutable' state, passing function as a reference, and so on).

When I browse on Twitter or GitHub, I found so many people that look so talented. They have many great projects, using fancy tools like Reactjs/Nextjs, and even still younger than me.

Sometimes, scrolling on social media and see so many people talented on their stuff motivate me to do so, on the other hand, it also makes me feel that I was nothing and so far behind them.

I know I shouldn't compare what I do to someone else's stuff. It's unfair to compare apples and oranges. I know I learn the same thing, but who knows something behind it, right? We are unique entities, everyone has their own path and time in this world.

It is better to focus on watering our own grass. Spend more time investing in ourselves and also accept where we are. I love a little life lesson that my mentor told me last month. She said it is important to accept something that you can't change, stop complaining about it and start to change things you can handle. What she wanna say was; it is easier to change our habits/behavior than change where we are born or what skin color we want.

It's fine to see someone else's chapter 10 as our motivation. But don't compare it to chapter 1 of us. We have a different stage of life. And we need to remember that our journey is never going to be the same as someone else's.

Mm not gonna lie, I don't know how to end this article, lol. I feel like I still wanna add some sentences as a closing part, but well, I don't know how, haha. Anyway, I love to see that I could deliver my opinion better than before and can express things in my head faster as well. Even so, my grammar still bad, haha. But, it's fine. Learning thing takes time tho.

Well, see ya next time!
