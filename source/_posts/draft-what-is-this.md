Hi, this is a part of the [Draft article](https://adisaktijrs.github.io/2020/12/22/draft-what-is-this/) where I wrote random thoughts to learn writing in English. So bear with me.
{% endblockquote %}

### Why?
After several moments of contemplating what I should do in my 20s, I plan to improve several things/skills that I wanna master in order to make my life easier in the future.

There are many things that I have planed and one of them is learning English (Anyway, I'll write the plans I have made in a separate article).

### My English sucks!
I admit that I never properly learned English. I was only learning its vocabularies without learning grammar and lack of practice as well.

Even so, I still did not learn grammar, because it was really boring, haha, and that's the reason why I always shy to express something in English. Because I know my grammar was bad and it's a shame tho.

So I planed to learn English through practice! And I decided to start with learning to write random things in English on my blog. The articles of this plan will be labeled as a 'Draft'.

I know it isn't the best way to improve my English but it is the most exciting one. Yeah, I love writing things! I will dedicate my nights to write random things every day on weekdays. I want to be used to it. Imagine, after several mos later, I could write and express anything I want in English, that's kind of cool right? Lol.

### Grammarly!
I plan to avoid Google Translate because I want to jump into English directly without using Bahasa first. But I do use Grammarly to improve and learn basic grammar and writing stuff on the fly!

Be ready and willing to be a beginner every morning. That's how you grow and step into your greatness

### Will it work?
Tbh, I'm not too sure haha. But it's fine to give it a go right?
