##### About Minima
Minima is an undoubtedly simple and lightweight dark/light mode theme for Hexo. I created this from scratch using [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com/) boilerplate. It only uses CSS and Vanilla JS, without using unnecessary third-party 'render-blocking' libraries.

###### Simplicity
Simplicity is a must! When I decided to move to Hexo for my personal blogging platform, the main reason was to find a simple and clean design, no fancy looks, unnecessary images and colors either. I'd like to have a blog that focuses on the content of my posts rather than turning readers attention to a 'cluttered' user interface. I found lots of beautiful themes on the Hexo themes page, but finally I decided to make my own.

###### Lightweight
This 'lightweight' means the theme uses as few design stuff as possible. Fewer JavaScript and CSS files. Minima only uses Skeleton for the CSS-boilerplate and [nanobar.js](https://nanobar.jacoborus.codes/) for the top loading bar. The following is the 'gross' performance of my blog with the Minima theme:

###### Customization
Minima uses vanilla JavaScript, vanilla CSS, and [EJS](https://ejs.co/). So it will be very easy for everyone to edit and customize the theme.

#### Documentation
##### Quick Start
Use the **stable** version
1. Download the [stable version here](https://github.com/adisaktijrs/hexo-theme-minima/archive/v1.0.zip). And **rename the folder to minima** and place it at the **themes folder** of your Hexo blog. New to Hexo? Watch this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-muxF_6plc)

Or you can use the **development** version&nbsp;
1. Execute this command in your terminal (at your Hexo blog root dir):
```
git clone https://github.com/adisaktijrs/hexo-theme-minima.git themes/minima
```
1. Modify the theme in Hexo configuration file **_config.yml** (config file in the root dir, not the theme config) by setting theme variable to **minima**
{% codeblock "_config.yml" lang:js %}

# Extensions
## Plugins: https://hexo.io/plugins/
## Themes: https://hexo.io/themes/
theme: minima

{% endcodeblock %}
1. That's all. To fully configure the Minima theme, follow the Configuration steps below!

##### Site Configuration
###### Code Highlighting
Minima uses Prism.js to highlight the code. So **modify the _config.yml of your site** to somewhat like this below:
{% codeblock "_config.yml" %}

highlight:
  enable: false #set it to false
  line_number: false
  auto_detect: false
  tab_replace: ''
  wrap: false #false
  hljs: false
prismjs:
  enable: true #set it to true
  preprocess: true
  line_number: true #optional
  tab_replace: ''
{% endcodeblock %}

Make sure your code highlight configuration is saved properly by **clearing the Hexo cache** and run your server. Run this command in your terminal:

```
$ hexo clean
$ hexo server
```
&nbsp;
###### SEO Image Thumbnail for Shared-link
Minima uses meta data for image preview when your Post link is shared to social media. Here the example when you share your Post link to Twitter:
![](Screenshot2.png)
To do that you must modify your **post_asset_folder variable** to true in your site _config.yml. See below:
{% codeblock "_config.yml" %}
# Writing

post_asset_folder: true #set it to true
{% endcodeblock %}

And then whenever you make a post, **add thumbnail** in your post .md file. See the example post below:
{% codeblock "/source/_posts/your-post.md" lang:js %}
---
title: Your Post
date: 2020-10-11 10:09:47
tags: [Tag1]
thumbnail: YourImage.jpg #Here is the image preview
---
{% endcodeblock %}

&nbsp;
